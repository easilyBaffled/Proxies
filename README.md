# What You Can Do With Proxies

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/easilyBaffled/What-You-Can-Do-With-Proxies.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Welcome to my brain. Or at least my brain as it dumped resources and assets for a lighting talk about [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
The talk was to show people the many different ways they use proxies. You can go through it yourself [here]( # SHAME )
( hint: click on the code-pane to progress through the example and then use the arrows to navigate between slides and  )
Or if future me has done his job you can watch a video of it [here]( # SHAME )

The slide content are in [`src/slides`](https://github.com/easilyBaffled/Proxies/tree/master/src/slides). All of my notes are also kept in there in Outline.md. 
The presentation itself was written as a React App using [Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/) so if you would like to run through it, clone the project run 

```
> git clone https://github.com/easilyBaffled/What-You-Can-Do-With-Proxies.git
> cd What-You-Can-Do-With-Proxies 
> npm i 
> npm startâ€™
```

The examples in the slides are are runnable if you would like to see the results for yourself.

There are also many more examples that didnâ€™t make it into the presentation in [`src/proxies/`]( https://github.com/easilyBaffled/What-You-Can-Do-With-Proxies/tree/master/src/proxies ). I encourage you to copy them out to a CodePen and play with them.
<sub>If you are reading this then it means I am still writing documentation and tests for the examples in proxy ðŸ˜”</sub>
